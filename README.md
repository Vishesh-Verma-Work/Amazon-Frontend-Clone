# Amazon-Frontend-Clone
This project, 'Amazon-Frontend-Clone,' represents my initial steps in web development. Created using online resources, it's a replica of Amazon's front-end, crafted with HTML and CSS. Made during my early learning journey, it reflects my commitment to mastering web development fundamentals.

Thank you for visiting my project! Your interest and support mean the world to me. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or get in touch. Your presence is truly appreciated.s
