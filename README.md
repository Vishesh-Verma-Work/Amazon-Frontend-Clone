# Amazon-Frontend-Clone
This project, 'Amazon-Frontend-Clone,' represents my initial steps in web development. Created using online resources, it's a replica of Amazon's front-end, crafted with HTML and CSS. Made during my early learning journey, it reflects my commitment to mastering web development fundamentals.
